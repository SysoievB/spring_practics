/*
The id column in the address table serves as both the primary key and the foreign key.
There is no separate foreign key column in the address table.

The relationship may appear "less visible" than with @JoinColumn
because there isnâ€™t a separately labeled foreign key column,
but it's directly defined in the schema.*/
